# advent-of-code-2022-kotlin

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [ripla][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository, ripla is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

## Note

The solutions in this repository are not meant to be optimal in regard to CPU or memory usage. They are optimised for the readability of the author.

The solutions are in the main source folder, input is in the main `resources` folder (e.g. `Day01.txt` and `Day01_test.txt`) and tests are in the `test` folder.

Input files are not included.

If you're stuck with Kotlin-specific questions or anything related to this template, check out the following resources:
